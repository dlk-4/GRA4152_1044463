GRA41522 : Object Oriented Programming with Python

1. Every file should be in the same directory.

2. To read the docstring, use Python’s built in help system:
    * help(MODULE_NAME)
    * python -c "import MODULE_NAME; help(MODULE_NAME)"
    * pydoc MODULE_NAME

3. When it comes to the doc string for this project, I followed the “CashRegister” class doc string format (Lecture, Oct 30).

4. For visualization options, the user can have PDF file in the same directory where "train_vae.py" is executed.
