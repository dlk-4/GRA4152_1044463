GRA41522 : Object Oriented Programming with Python

1. Every file should be in the same directory.

2. For visualization, the user can have PDF file in the same directory where "train_vae.py" is executed.

3. To read the docstring, use Python’s built in help system:
    * help(MODULE_NAME)
    * python -c "import MODULE_NAME; help(MODULE_NAME)"
    * pydoc MODULE_NAME

4. When it comes to the doc string for this project, I followed the “CashRegister” class doc string format (Lecture, Oct 30).
